title: Queens - A Strategic Puzzle Game
published: true
---

I recently built a web-based puzzle game called **Queens** using Vue.js and Vite. The game challenges players to place queens on a chess board so that no queen can attack another queen - a classic algorithmic problem that's both engaging and educational.

This implementation was inspired by [Fotis Adamakis's excellent article](https://fadamakis.com/recreating-queens-game-in-vue-d7e3b3013ccb) on recreating the Queens game in Vue, which provided valuable insights into the game mechanics and implementation approach.

## Key Features & Improvements

### ðŸŽ® **Enhanced Gameplay**
- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard puzzles with different board layouts
- **Smart Timer**: Starts only on first move, with pause/resume functionality
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of valid/invalid queen placements with smooth animations

### ðŸŽ¨ **Modern Design**
- **Minimal Color Scheme**: Soft, differentiated pastel colors for better visibility
- **Clean Typography**: Dark blue title with improved readability
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

### âš¡ **Technical Enhancements**
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Modern reactive state management
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with composables
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering and state updates

The game features a clean, modern interface with intuitive controls, multiple difficulty levels, and a timer to track performance. Players can place queens by clicking on empty squares, and the game provides immediate visual feedback about valid and invalid placements.

Built with Vue 3's Composition API, the game demonstrates modern web development practices including reactive state management, component composition, and responsive design. The codebase is structured with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to extend with new features like different board sizes or additional game modes.
